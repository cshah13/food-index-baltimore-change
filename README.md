## Background Information
[According to The Johns Hopkins University Center for Liveable Future (CLF)](https://mdfoodsystemmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Atlas_CLF-Food-Swamp_final.pdf.), food deserts are defined as locations which lack access to affordable, healthy food options. CLF defines food deserts as areas where the closest supermarket is more than ¼ mile away, the median household income is below 185% of the federal poverty level, 40% of homes do not have vehicles, and supermarkets have low Healthy Food Availability Index (HFAI) scores. Additionally, food swamps exist within food deserts. Food swamps are locations where there is greater accessibility to unhealthy foods compared to healthy foods.

In 2018, [the CLF released a report](https://clf.jhsph.edu/about-us/news/news-2018/report-food-desert-gets-name-change-response-baltimore-community-feedback) stating that the term “food deserts” in Baltimore, Maryland was replaced by Healthy Food Priority Areas to avoid the negative connotations associated with the previous term. Researchers at the CLF found that 23.5% of residents in Baltimore reside in a Healthy Food Priority Area. The overall health status and outcomes related to diets are worse in Baltimore City than the Maryland average. Individuals in Healthy Food Priority Areas throughout Baltimore are experiencing poor health outcomes, so the CLF suggests that increased accessibility to healthy food options can contribute to an equitable food environment. 

The Baltimore City Health Department has a [variety of programs](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/food-access) in place to increase food access through the Baltimarket program—a set of community-based interventions. A Virtual Supermarket Program has been implemented to provide a grocery delivery service in low income communities that do not have vehicular access to seek healthy food choices. Additionally, Baltimore Food Justice Forum provides residents with resources to obtain healthy and affordable foods in their respective neighborhoods. These community based efforts are aimed to implement impactful solutions that mitigate Healthy Food Priority Areas. 

Although there are interventions in place, there is more work that needs to be done to mitigate Healthy Food Priority Areas throughout Baltimore. If this problem is not addressed, it will continue to have detrimental effects on the health of the population. This analysis aims to analyze types of supermarkets in Baltimore areas, average household incomes, and HFAI scores to inform and guide the direction of the Baltimore City Health Department programs.

## Data Answer

The Baltimore City Government data provides Healthy Food Availability Index scores throughout Baltimore communities in 2012 and 2015. The analysis shows that there is little variation that occured in the three years. Some areas had an increase in Healthy Food Availability Index scores, while a majority of areas declined. The analysis shows that 38/56 of the areas in Baltimore had a decline in Healthy Food Index Scores. As of 2021, we know this is a problem that organizations such as the Baltimore City Health Department and Johns Hopkins Center for Liveable Future are attempting to address. This data provides those organizations with specific locations where the Healty Food Availability Index needs to be further addressed and improved. Furhter analysis is needed to determine why the scores declined in many locations.
