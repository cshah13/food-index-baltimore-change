Both a double line graph and double bar graph were created to visualize trends for this analysis. The Baltimore City Government data provides Healthy Food Availability Index scores throughout Baltimore communities in 2012 and 2015. The line graph shows general trends throughout Baltimore, while the bar graph is more specific by showing all location names. The analysis shows that there is little variation that occured in the three years. Some areas had an increase in Healthy Food Availability Index scores, while many others had a decrease. The analysis shows that 38/56 of the areas in Baltimore had a decline in Healthy Food Index Scores. As of 2021, we know this is a problem that organizations such as the Baltimore City Health Department and Johns Hopkins Center for Liveable Future are attempting to address. This data provides those organizations with specific locations where the Healty Food Availability Index needs to be further addressed and improved. Furhter analysis is needed to determine why the scores declined in many locations.
